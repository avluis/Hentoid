##### `Hendroid` is an ad-free Doujinshi & H-Manga archiving and viewing app.
###### `Hendroid` currently supports:
###### [nhentai](https://nhentai.net/), [hentai cafe](https://hentai.cafe/), [hitomi](https://hitomi.la/), [asmhentai](http://asmhentai.com/), [tsumino](http://www.tsumino.com/), [pururin](https://pururin.io/), [e-hentai](https://e-hentai.org/), [Hentai Nexus](https://hentainexus.com) and [8muses](https://www.8muses.com).

Hendroid is a fork of the popular app [Hentoid](https://github.com/avluis/Hentoid). 
It removes all tracking and updating (because it's intended to update only on F-droid). Additionally, viewing on external apps is allowed (not default, functionality is removed on Hentoid) and has more sensible defaults (app is not hidden by default, allows screenshots). 
To prevent confusion, the app name has been changed and the logo modified. Copyright belongs to contributors of the original project.
