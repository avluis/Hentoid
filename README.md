Hendroid is a fork of the popular app [Hentoid](https://github.com/avluis/Hentoid). 
It **removes all tracking** and updating (because it's intended to update only on F-droid). It's available on the [**F-droid repository**](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.nonononoki.hendroid).

To prevent confusion, the app name has been changed and the logo modified. Copyright belongs to the contributors of the original project.
