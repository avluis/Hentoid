New

    The app is now available in Russian on devices where default language is Russian
    New DNS over HTTPS provider : AdGuard
    Support for animated WEBP pictures

Changed

    External books icon has been updated : folder or archive, depending on the nature of the external source

Fixed

    Hitomi : The app now downloads WEBP pictures only. JPGs and PNGs are not available anymore
    NB : Please use "redownload from scratch" on your Hitomi queued downloads if they still generate errors.
    Changing the DNS over HTTPS provider doesn't disrupt the download queue anymore
    Changing the DNS over HTTPS provider doesn't disrupt e-hentai, exhentai, Luscious and Pixiv ability to download anymore
    Downloader has been partially rewritten and now does its best to avoid getting stuck ;-)
    Restoring groups from a clean install now remembers favourites
    "Ungrouped" custom group is now visible at all times
