Fixed

    Hitomi : Align with new site layout - use "redownload from scratch" to fix your error queue
    NB : Hitomi downloads are slower due to a new speed limiter Hitomi have set up. The app has no choice but to align on it.
    Hitomi : Remove huge blank ad space on top of pages
    IMHentai : Remove ads
    MyReadingManga : Artist is now detected by using the book's title, when available (e.g. "[Artist] Title")
    MyReadingManga : All chapters are now correctly detected and downloaded
    Fix a bug that allowed to bypass the PIN lock
    Library / Groups : Going from the books screen back to the groups screen now keeps the initial scrolling on the groups screen
    Duplicate detector : Options menu can now be opened after viewing duplicate details
    A few performance optimizations on advanced search
    A few performance optimizations on file I/O (might speed up queue processing for some users)
