Queue screen : Progress display of redownloads from scratch has been improved
Library screen : "Download date" sorting field has evolved into two different fields
"Download date (processed)" : First time when a download is completed, regardless of the outcome (same as the old "Download date" you've been using until now)
"Download date (completed)" : When a download is completed successfuly (i.e. with 100% of its pages)
Viewer : Sharing a picture doesn't automatically add a "Share picture" label anymore
